# Overview

This small web app is an experiment of implementing the [ChatPDF API](https://www.chatpdf.com/docs/api/backend).

In the website, you are able to talk to a specific PDF you've uploaded manualy using the instructions in the documentation for ChatPDF. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

Used Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS for the front-end. And JQuery for the JavaScript logic. This code is meant to be served on a server so I would not recomend publishing it as is.
